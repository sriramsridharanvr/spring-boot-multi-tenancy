# Different Multi Tenancy Approaches with Spring Boot
In this repository, I have tried my hand at creating two different multi tenancy approaches.

1. Discriminator Based Strategy
2. Schema per tenant strategy

In addition, there is also a third project, which implements both of these strategies in a single application, with a configuration property that can be used to choose the preferred strategy.
